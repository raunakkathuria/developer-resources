# Useful resources for a developer career path

A list of useful resources for a developer as they progress through their career.

Each topic has resource(s) listed as per what is the best-though opinionated-reading materials, related course, or corresponding video for each topic.

The resources listed here are language and technology-agnostic, except the database topic, where PostgreSQL is listed. I would suggest referring to https://roadmap.sh/ for a roadmap specific to your career path.

For more computer science topics, or if you are just starting as a computer science graduate, I would highly recommend referring to https://teachyourselfcs.com/. They have structured the content really well, and most of the references are inspired from that site.

> Note: As with any software related topic, some references may be debatable. This is just to provide a good reference for use, may not be the best references out there.

## Developer

If you are starting as a developer, it's very important to have a strong base to start your career. The resources listed below will help you develop that base.

Study all the topics below, in roughly the presented order, using either the suggested reading, video or course materials.

## Tech Lead/Principal Engineer/Architect

As you gain more experience, having system design and system architecture knowledge becomes really valuable. It's good to understand the basics of it so that you can find out common system patterns and design the system better.
